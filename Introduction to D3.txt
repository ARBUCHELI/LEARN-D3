# INTRODUCTION TO D3
--------------------
Why D3?
The name d3 comes from the three D’s in the term “Data-Driven Documents.” This JavaScript data-visualization library rose in popularity because of a few game-changing features:

	. d3 revolutionized the way data visualizations are built natively for the web by associating data with elements on a website’s Document Object Model.

	. d3 is a visually elegant library that offers a wide range of pre-packaged visualizations (from Tree-models to Sankey funnels)

	. d3 leaves a lot of room for creative customization because the elements the data are bound to can be styled like any regular DOM element

	. d3 supports interactivity triggered by browser events

In this lesson, we won’t be creating the fanciest d3 visualization you’ve ever seen. We’ll enter the world of d3 by taking our time to understand how data is bound to elements and how to 
customize the appearance of our elements based on this data.
